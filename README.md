## 🧩 The Problem

In many cities, civic issues often go unreported or unresolved due to:
- Opacity: Citizens don't know the status of their reports.
- Inaccuracy: Manual location descriptions lead to confusion for repair crews.
- Redundancy: Multiple people reporting the same pothole creates data noise.
- Friction: Complicated login processes prevent quick reporting.
- Citizens rarely receive updates once a complaint is raised, leading to frustration and mistrust in governance systems.

## 💡 Our Solution

CivicConnect provides a zero-cost, web-based solution where:
- Interactive Map Reporting: Users drop a pin to capture exact coordinates (Latitude/Longitude).
- Public Dashboard: A transparent view of all civic issues and their current resolution status.
- Intelligent Grouping: A "Report Same Issue" feature that increases priority without cluttering the database.
- Visual Analytics: Dynamic charts to help authorities identify high-frequency problem zones.
- This system ensures end-to-end visibility from complaint submission to resolution.
