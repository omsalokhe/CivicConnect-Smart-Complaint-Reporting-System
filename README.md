# CivicConnect-Smart-Complaint-Reporting-System
CivicConnect is a smart, citizen-driven web platform that empowers people to report real-world civic issues like garbage, road damage, and broken streetlights. By enabling community participation, issue visibility, and admin-led resolution, it promotes transparency, faster action, and stronger civic responsibility at zero cost.


🧩 Problem Statement
In many cities, civic issues often go unreported or unresolved due to:
-> Lack of a unified complaint platform
-> No transparency in complaint resolution
-> Manual and inefficient tracking processes
-> Absence of digital accountability
Citizens rarely receive updates once a complaint is raised, leading to frustration and mistrust in governance systems.

💡 Proposed Solution
CivicConnect provides a zero-cost, web-based solution where:
-> Citizens can report issues with location details (manual input)
-> Complaints are stored and tracked digitally
-> Status updates are visible to both users and admins
-> Administrators can mark complaints as resolved
-> Duplicate complaints are intelligently grouped
This system ensures end-to-end visibility from complaint submission to resolution.
