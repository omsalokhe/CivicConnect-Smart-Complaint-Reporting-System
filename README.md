# CivicConnect-Smart-Complaint-Reporting-System
CivicConnect is a smart, citizen-driven web platform that empowers people to report real-world civic issues like garbage, road damage, and broken streetlights. By enabling community participation, issue visibility, and admin-led resolution, it promotes transparency, faster action, and stronger civic responsibility at zero cost.


## 🧩 Problem Statement

In many cities, civic issues often go unreported or unresolved due to:
- Lack of a unified complaint platform
- No transparency in complaint resolution
- Manual and inefficient tracking processes
- Absence of digital accountability
- Citizens rarely receive updates once a complaint is raised, leading to frustration and mistrust in governance systems.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

CivicConnect provides a zero-cost, web-based solution where:
- Citizens can report issues with location details (manual input)
- Complaints are stored and tracked digitally
- Status updates are visible to both users and admins
- Administrators can mark complaints as resolved
- Duplicate complaints are intelligently grouped
- This system ensures end-to-end visibility from complaint submission to resolution.
